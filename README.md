# iptracker
This is an IP tracker. After installing and running the project you must create a .env file in the root folder to add your tokens for [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/). If you going to fork this repo and work over it, **please use a .env.local file** to store these tokens. In this way, you will not upload your tokens to GitHub (you can use secrets or another way, but is the simplest one).
### Steps:
1. Go to [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and create your account.
2. Get your Mapbox Token
3. Create your .env (or .env.local) file in root folder (same level where package.json file is)
4. Type inside this file:
```
VUE_APP_TOKEN="put-here-your-token"
```
5. Go to [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/) and create an account.
6. Go to Docs and select the `API Type 2: Country + City` tab. There you will find an URL, you must take this one.
7. Type inside your .env (or .env.local) file this URL like this: 
```
VUE_APP_GET_IP_URL="https://geo.ipify.org/api/v2/country,city?apiKey=yourApiKey="
```
8. Save this .env (or .en.local) file and restart the server.

This is enough to start to work, now you can search any IP Address ;)
